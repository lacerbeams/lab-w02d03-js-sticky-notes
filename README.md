# Getting Sticky
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add structure to a web page from the DOM point of view. Build a page where the user can create a series of notes to the page, edit the content, and delete the notes. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## MVP

When a user visits the site...
   
    - they should see text called "Total number of notes:", initially this should be set to zero 
    - there should be a button that says "Add A NOTE"

When a user clicks on the "Add A Note" button 
    
     - a new editable note appended to the page
     - the total note counter needs to be updated


### Feature Requests
- User needs to delete some notes, when they become outdated. Add a "X" on the notes so they can be disposed when the "X" is clicked

### Bonus
- Add a datetime stamp for the note, when it is created
- When a user updates a note the datetime should change
